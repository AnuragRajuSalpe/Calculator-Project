# Calculator-Project
This is a Simple Calculator that you can use directly in your web browser. It's built with HTML, which sets up all the buttons and the display screen; CSS, which makes it look clean and easy to use; and JavaScript, which handles all the math and makes sure the calculator actually works when you press the numbers and operations.
